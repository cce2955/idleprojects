/*	So I'm getting a little burnt out on redux and I'm gonna have to grind at 
 * that to get into it, however I'm having fun with java, so I'll be doing 
 * tiny little (and I mean little) projects here
*/

/* project ideas
 * 
 * Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. 
 * You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, 
 * but you should support inputs up to at least one million 
 * (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, 
 * if that's less). Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers
 *  (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).
 * 
 * Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single 
 * coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the
 * outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.
