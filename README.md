This is a little project I'm doing to test out my java skills, it utilizes Java FX to create a gui you can cycle through various projects

## Currently Working on
##### Budget Calculator
Input values for money earned and spent over a period of time, see a percentage change, may implement something to work on budget goals

## Current Projects so far
##### General Testing
Added unit tests for 90% of the modules just to see how testing works, tests have guided me towards some edge cases.
